## How to debug code

1. Add print statements to carefully determine and debug actual issue.
2. Set up smaller test or scripts to isolate the isue itself
3. Suggest fixes and causes and present them for review.
4. If the user accepts the fixes, implement them. Always ask for confirmation before implementing fixes.
5. If the issue is a obvious syntax typo, please dont ask for user approve and fix it immediately.

Use uv with pytest to run tests.
